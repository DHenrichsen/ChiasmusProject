# ChiasmusProject

We are using the Stanford NLP package shown above for a significant portion of our work.

This project's source code is stored in a private BitBucket repository. This is the extent of the code that is currently public, with the rest following once we have published our paper.

For an interested party, the place to start to understand what we are doing is with the powerpoint presentation in the repository. Cheers!
